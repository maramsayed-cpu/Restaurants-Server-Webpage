Files:
server.js (server file)
stats.pug (template engine)
example-menu-data.txt
frodo.json
lembas.json
aragorn.json
orderForm.html
home.html

Design Choices:
I made the position of the category names fixed, so that the user can click to the section they want wherever they are in the page.
The width of the columns scales based on the size of the window.

To run the server file:
install pug using "npm install pug"
then run the server using "node server.js" and copy the link thats printed out and paste it into a browser
