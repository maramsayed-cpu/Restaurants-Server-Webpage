orderForm.html
home.html


Design Choices:
I chose to keep the orderForm javascript in the html file to make it easier to read
I made the position of the category names fixed, so that the user can click to the section they want wherever they are in the page.
The width of the columns scales based on the size of the window.

To run the server file:
install pug using "npm install pug"
then run the server using "node server.js" and copy the link thats printed out and paste it into a browser
